# Worker Fatalities

This is a map of fatalities and catastrophes [reported to OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/dep_fatcat.html) and the Department of Labor from 2009 to the present.

The data was processed using [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/zischwartz/workerfatalities/blob/master/data/processs.ipynb) where location data was added using Google's geocoding API. As such, some locations are approximate, if for instance no address is given and google is unable find the business name.
